## Abstract

Transient compartmentalization is essential to avoid parasites (short non-functional RNA sequences) to invade a molecular replicating system, but how  compartmentalization dynamics specifically affect the host-parasite dynamics is unclear. To address this issue, we perform a combination of experiments with modeling, to show that compositional memory is present in this experiment and matters for early molecular systems.
