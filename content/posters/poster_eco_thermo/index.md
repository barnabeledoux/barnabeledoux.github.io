## Abstract

We develop a macro-financial model that establishes a link between credit dynamics, economic growth, and cumulative carbon emissions. We introduce a path-dependent carbon intensity that decreases with partial decarbonization, interest-driven default risk, and leverage (debt financing) by extending stochastic gambling models. This framework captures a critical but often neglected mechanism: credit expansion amplifies GDP growth and associated emissions, thereby locking economies into higher cumulative carbon trajectories, even as energy efficiency improves. To verify that the model would capture the observed proportionality between cumulative GDP and cumulative CO2 emissions, we empirically calibrate it for the United States, China, France, and Denmark using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data. Our findings suggest that systematically, high-leverage economies experience stronger emission lock-in, whereas surplus economies approach near-neutral trajectories, even if this might reflect the offshoring of emissions. Additionally, our stochastic analysis identifies an optimal leverage frontier: the probability of long-term solvency collapses when intrinsic growth falls below the interest rate, irrespective of leverage, thereby underscoring a natural financial limit to debt-fueled growth. These findings collectively quantify the relationship between financial debt and ”carbon debt,” indicating that credit allocation should be prioritised for low-carbon investment in order to mitigate systemic risk and prevent emissions overshoot. Our approach complements conventional Integrated Assessment Models by explicitly linking fiscal and financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, thus enabling the assessment of policies for their alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero
 pathways.
