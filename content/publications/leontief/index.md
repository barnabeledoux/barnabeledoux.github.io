##### Abstract

A stoichiometric theory of autocatalysis is outlined, which is based on the notion of productivity (either economical or chemical). The framework is applied to the von Neumann universal constructor model as an example. New methods of identifying autocatalytic subnetworks in complex chemical networks follow from this approach.
